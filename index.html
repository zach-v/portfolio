		<p class="lead">Throughout my years at Southern Illinois University I have been heavily involved on campus through registered student organizations, annual university events, interdepartmental events, and faculty training where I was able to express my passions through organized planning and resource skills.</p>
		<hr>
		<h4 class="text-uppercase">Student Organizations</h4>
		<h5 class="text-uppercase">SIU Esports</h5>
		<p class="lead">I origanlly started an organization called "Club Rhythm" which was an arcade rhythm game focused club. We had aspects of competitiveness which is when the president of the SIU Esports club contacted me to merge with them in the Spring semester of 2018 (January). When we joined with the esports club I was made the secretary of the organization until the Fall semester of 2018 (December). When I decided to stay at SIU to continue my master's degree, I became the vice president in the following Spring semester of 2019. I was the vice president until the president left SIU in the fall semester of 2019 (September) to which I became the President of the esports club. Throughout my time within the esports organization I constantly organized the large number of members to regular meetings, officer meetings with University staff, Staff meetings to go over facility logistics, and tournaments for the many games under esports.</p>
		<h5 class="text-uppercase">SIU Aikido Club</h5>
		<p class="lead">I joined the SIU Aikido club out of curiosity for the martial art as it didn't focus on just being a bigger stronger guy who could hit other big strong guys. It focused on the bigger picture of body control and movement, and how focusing on yourself while being relaxed effected others that were connected to you. It was a way I can focus on self perfection, consistency in what I did, and an amazing outlet for the general stress of University class load. I joined the club when there was a low number of 4 or 5 other students in the club in the Fall semester of 2017 (September). A year had passed and I had achieved 2 ranks before going to a national conference with some of the best Aikido master's across the nation, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AnnualAsuWinterIntensive/">Winter Intensive 2019</a>. After that we had begun the transitional period from the current president in the group to me where I would take on the position near the end of Spring 2019. It wasn't until a new policy was added to all sports clubs on campus in November of 2019 that no single individual could be the president of 2 or more clubs where I pushed to hold elections and I was transitioned out of being the president of the club.</p>
		<hr>
		<h4 class="text-uppercase">University Events</h4>
		<p class="lead">I have been on the planning commity for the Saluki Con for two years, an event that started as a comic con which brings hundreds of people from around the midwest area. For this event each year I acted as the esports tournament coordinator and advisor for other convention events. <br>Another event that I started and hope will continue was a GameJam event that ran alongside the annual Hackathon hosted by <a href="https://hacksi.org/">HackSI</a>. I used the Esports club as a way to gain legitamacy in the organization of the event, and worked with HackSI to bring 20 participants for the first GameJam that would happen in the SIU area. Hopefully this will continue as it was an amazing exerience for some of the childeren that participate in the event.</p>
		<hr>
		<h4 class="text-uppercase">Interdepartmental Events</h4>
		<p class="lead">Being the Graduate Assistant for the College Of Liberal Arts means that I would be actively working under the Dean, Associate Dean, and the Student Retention Coordinator for the college (department). Frequently events between the colleges (departments) would be a good oportunity for students to feel more connected to their respective majors and staff. I would often be assisting or even running these events.<br>An example of an event that I organized, and ran myself was a COLA (College of Liberal Arts) ping pong tournament where there was a student bracket and a faculty and staff bracket. The winners of each bracket would face off for a trophy and be claimed the king of ping pong. We had 12 students and 8 faculty and staff compete from 6 different departments.</p>
    	<hr>
		<h4 class="text-uppercase">Staff Training</h4>
		<p class="lead">I am often refered to as someone with many hats. I would like the think that in the face of adversity, I am able to utilize my past exeriences and overcome. If there are any problems that are brought up to me, I typically don't have difficulty solving them. However, I understand that I am only a Graduate Student and I don't plan to be at the University forever. This means that I needed to help everyone around me learn all the different things that I would normally be tasked with daily. I constantly have the mindset of trying to teach someone how to do something so they can feel more confident approaching the problem later on.<br>An example of this can be seen from how I normally organize group projects for my Computer Science classes. I typically use a site called <a href="https://freedcamp.com/">Freedcamp</a> to help organize all these different projects. I expressed this organized method to my boss, and next thing I know I am explaining how to use the site to my peers and to my other employers. It is now being used regularly to help organize the workflow of the environment.</p>

Took that data stream and used fast fourier transform to organize frequencies into a list. Based on ranges that modularly scale with on the volume input from the audio, it visually displays terrain generation, cube translations, a frequency spectrum, and hue values based on that audio data.</p>

The enemy in the game expresses machine learning concepts where it will build itself based on the play of the user. If a user continues to do poorly against a specific strategy the enemy employes, then the enemy should continue to employ that strategy to win against the user.</p>
